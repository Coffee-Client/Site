                        <p>
                            The UI of coffee is one you have probably never seen before in a 1.18.2 client. The developers
                            understand OpenGL and GLFW to the absolute max, and can provide a stunning UI experience for anyone.

                    <sl-details summary="How does the GUI look?">
                        <p>
                            Coffee has a very easy to use gui, that is designed to make usage as simple as it can be. Almost
                            everything can be controlled with just one easy click.
                        </p>

                    <sl-details summary="Which features does it have?">
                        <p>
                            Coffee has 107+ vanilla modules, and the ability to load custom modules from addons made by the
                            community. Possibilities are quite literally endless.
                        </p>
                    </sl-details>
                    <sl-details summary="Does it support addons?">
                        <p>
                            Yes! Addons are a part of Coffee's ecosystem, and can even be reloaded and disabled on the fly. No
                            pesky reloading of the entire client (cough cough meteor).

                    <sl-details summary="Is it compatible with XYZ?">
                        <p>
                            Probably not, but we work hard to make Coffee as compatible as possible. As of now, it works with some
                            big clients like meteor, but we still need to test many more.
